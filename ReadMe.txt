CSCI E-90 Final Project - "HES ChatBot" by Lyndon Jen

These files are relevant for easier re-building of my HES ChatBot project:
- HES_Courses.json : this file should go into the S3 bucket
- lambda_function.py : the Python code inside this file needs to go into the Lambda function
- testALMCybersecurity35 : the JSON structure inside this file is for the test event to test the Lambda function
- testALMSystemsEngineering46 : the JSON structure inside this file is for the test event to test the Lambda function

Great class!
